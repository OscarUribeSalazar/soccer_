README files need to be descriptive to allow anyone to understand our project, the contents of our repository, and how to use it.

It is the first file a person will see, and as a data professional, it is a crucial skill to communicate a project to others. 

**Consider it to be the instruction manual for our repository.**

## README fundamentals
Some essential items are 
* the project title, 
* a description of the technology used and why,
* a description of the process used to answer the question and why, and 
* table of contents.

## README extras
Other characteristics of a good README are if it includes 
* details of how the project came about and *
*  the motivation behind it,
*  any limitations or challenges encountered,
*  a recap of the problem it intends to solve,
*  and what its intended use is.
*  if we are sourcing information from elsewhere, itâ€™s also essential to include the necessary credits.
